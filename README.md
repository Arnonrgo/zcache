## What is ZooCache
ZooCache is a simple cache implementation on top of  [ZooKeeperâ„¢](http://zookeeper.apache.org/)


## Main Features

1. A cache with ZooKeeper capabilities (fault tolerance, distributed, etc.)
2. TTL for items
3. Can use a local shadow (simple LRU cache) to save on network calls
4. Ability to invalidate local shadow even if TTL has not passed

The project is currently compiled and tested with Scala 2.9.1
